# Poudre_Water_Monitor
The goal of this project is to design and build a flow sensor to track seasonal streams in the Poudre Canyon. Following the High Park fire which burned an estimated 87,250 acres, much of the topography was altered due to the destruction of the vegetation, soil and natural erosion blocks. This has allowed streams to form, leading to a change in the water that flows into the Poudre river. A conservation group in Fort Collins has paired with a professor at CSU to try and promote a citizen science effort to map the seasonal streams which have been created as a result of the fire.

The primary goals for the sensor are as follows:

1) Inexpensive
2) Able to operate unsupervised for up to 1 year
3) Record and store data in such a way that it can be collected without removing the sensor
4) Durable- waterproof and debris resistant
